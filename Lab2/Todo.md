P-2.34 Define a Polygon interface that has methods area( ) and perimeter( ). Then implement classes for Triangle, Quadrilateral, Pentagon, Hexagon, and Octagon, which implement this interface, with the obvious meanings for the area( ) and perimeter( ) methods. Also implement classes, IsoscelesTriangle, EquilateralTriangle, Rectangle, and Square, which have the appropriate inheritance relationships. Finally, write a simple user interface, which allows users to create polygons of the various types, input their geometric dimensions, and then output their area and perimeter.
